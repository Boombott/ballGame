-- This was basic inventory was taken from CORE Royale.
-- Releasing for Cogswell GGJ, yet actually still in progress. 

--[[ TO USE
1) Drag the "CRoyale - Inventory" in. 
2) Drag the example "Legendary Shotgun" in. 
3) Press play and have the player pick up the gun. 
4) Profit. 


TO USE WITH YOUR OWN EQUIPMENT/WEAPON
- Look at the "Legendary Shotgun" as an example template-- any equipment or weapon
you want to work with this Inventory API must have the "WeaponPickupTriggerServer" script
with the custom property "API" that references to "APIBasicInventory".
- The best approach is to swap out the geometry and abilities, but use the example legendary shotgun as the starting point.
